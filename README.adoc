py-nltools
----------

A collection of abstraction layers and support functions that form the natural
language processing foundation of the Zamia AI project:
 
* `phonetics`: translation functions between various phonetic alphabets (IPA, X-SAMPA, X-ARPABET, ...)
* `tts`: abstraction layer towards using eSpeak NG, MaryTTS, SVOX Pico TTS or a remote TTS server and sequitur g2p
* `asr`: abstraction layer towards using kaldi-asr and pocketsphinx, models can be found here: http://goofy.zamia.org/voxforge/
* `sequiturclient`: g2p using sequitur
* `pulseplayer`: audio playback through pulseaudio
* `pulserecorder`: audio recording through pulseaudio
* `tokenizer`: english, french and german word tokenizers aimed at spoken language applications
* `threadpool`: simple thread pool implementation
* `vad`: Voice Activity Detection finite state machine based on webrtc VAD
* `macro_engine`: Simple macro engine aimed at generating natural language expansions

I plan to add modules as I need them in the Zamia AI projects. Some modules like `phonetics` and `tokenizer`
have some overlap with larger projects like NLTK or spaCy - my modules tend to be more hands-on and simple minded
than these and therefore are in no way meant to replace them.
